## Learnings & Takeaways (Summary)

### 中文版（Executive Bullet Points）

- 职涯转型通常不是一次“跳槽豪赌”，而是持续的自我校准：评估状态、调整方向、再投入。
- 高绩效有代价：推动你赢到顶峰的投入度，也可能在价值观变化后引发身心耗竭。
- “幸运”往往是外界的误读；真正可复制的是长期纪律、稳定训练与关键时刻的执行力。
- 当目标感下降、恢复成本升高时，尽早承认“该换赛道”比硬撑更专业、更可持续。
- 放下旧身份不是失败，而是策略升级：从“证明自己”转向“匹配长期生活与能力结构”。
- 自信来自准备深度：越清楚自己在做什么、为什么做，越能承受外界评价与不确定性。
- 可执行建议：每季度做一次职业体检（精力、成就感、成长性、生活匹配度），并提前建设可迁移能力。
- 选择新机会时，优先“相邻赛道”：利用既有优势，同时扩大第二曲线，而不是完全从零开始。

### English (Executive Bullet Points)

- Career reinvention is usually a sequence of calibrated moves, not one dramatic leap.
- Peak performance has a cost: the same intensity that drives results can eventually create burnout.
- What appears to be “luck” is often disciplined preparation, consistency, and repeat execution.
- Early recognition of misalignment is a strength; delaying the pivot usually increases personal and performance risk.
- Leaving a prestigious role is not failure; it can be a strategic reallocation toward better long-term fit.
- Confidence is built through preparation depth: clarity of purpose, craft mastery, and informed decision-making.
- Practical playbook: run regular career check-ins on energy, meaning, growth, and life-fit.
- Build transferable skills before the switch, then move through adjacent opportunities to reduce downside while expanding upside.

Speaker A: Too much of podcasting is badly supported by Victoria Police, who are looking for more women to join their ranks. Consider making the switch and explore Korea with Victoria Police. Physical link in the show notes. Don't have to police.vic.gov.au. I felt like I was losing control of my own narrative. So I left a network contract and for most people on TV, that is akin to death. It's like, how could you possibly walk away from climbing the screen? Every woman remembers the time they were two sizes up at work. Too ambitious, too soft, too bossy. Hi, I'm Brianna Blackett, your host for season three of Too Much. The switch. I started out as a journalist. I lived abroad and traveled the world, helping to cover breaking news. I co-founded an international news organization, but this is becoming apparent as a solo parent to my two kids. It is my working life has needed to change over and over again. And I'm not alone. Join me as I interview eight extraordinary women who made the switch from one career to another and found success. We'll also find out how defying the suffocating stereotypes women face at work helped them get there. She was winning Olympic gold medals and world championships in the pool. But at the glittering peak of her career, she was burned out. At age 23, Jian Rui retired from competitive swimming, and she chased new adrenaline highs as a TV presenter. But when this career path landed her in a job that didn't fit, and saw her receiving harsh criticism from viewers, Jian pivoted again. And this time, it was a switch you would never see coming. Today, Jian joins us to travel through her pivots and explore how, at each turn, being too invested has seen her rise to dazzling heights, and how putting aside ego has given her the courage to change lanes and
Speaker B: have Thanks
Speaker A: a crack at something new.
Speaker B: for watching!
Speaker A: Do you have any takes on how much we're donating on some too much? Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to have a chat.
Speaker B: Yeah, well, the thing is we're talking to women who've made the switch from one career to another. And you know how it works. Can you tell us a little bit about your career journey?
Speaker A: I think I've switched careers three or four times already. I feel it's happened many, many times in my nearly 43 years on the planet. And I think for me, it's been a really exciting journey because it means I've been able to explore each one throughout its entirety. And then each segue or the universe has led me to what is next. And I think for me, the biggest thing has always been listening to what's out there, taking advantage of opportunities. And if something is, I guess, having this little bit of excitement about exploring that particular path, then you've got to go for it.
Speaker B: Well, we're planning with two investment as you're too something. You're too much. Can you tell us a little bit about what being too invested looks like? I guess I do everything with a lot of passion with a lot of emotion and if I'm going to explore something if I'm going to have a say about something if I'm going to be conversational or in-depth in anything in my life then I need to be heavily invested I need to make sure that I research I need to know that I know what I'm talking about I know my stuff and ultimately that is what you need to put into this to be out there and public and having a go and having a crack so definitely throughout my life I think too invested is a great way to describe me Well, I'm really keen to jump into helping too invested help you and turn this into your career, but that's not where your career began. Your actual career began at age. And yeah, just a
Speaker @: quick,
Speaker B: I mean, you sound sort of like when you joined the Australian swimming team. Was that a childhood dream of yours? Are you actually good at it?
Speaker A: funly enough I feel very much for lean to swimming I got off a coin saying I look at them as a baby I had straight correction as a child but it wasn't until I was at my primary school swimming carnival I was a living and I managed to do fairly well and win a few events and a friend of mine who's a year older in the grade above me said you're really good you should join a swimming club I was like that sounds great I love mom and dad so at 11 I started squad training and I started two afternoons a week and I loved it so much that I begged to go three afternoons a week and it really just grew from there I could not spend more time in the pool I absolutely loved it and then once my coach made us cultural said you know you've got a real chance to do something in the sport of swimming but you need to dedicate yourself to it now and that means winter training and that means morning training you gotta do it while you're young you've got to put in the hard yards now so why don't you give it 12 months and see what happens you perhaps so
Speaker B: Yeah
Speaker A: I definitely thought I did and I went to those Australian championships as a 15 year old and with no thought process of making the Australian team and I actually need to make the Queensland team at that stage to go to these Australian championships I just from a time that was a qualifying time and so when I got third in the women's 100 backstroke as a 15 year old they didn't need to select me on the team it's only the top two that are guaranteed if you like and third place for Commonwealth Games team back then had a bit of judges election if you like there was a criteria they could take you if they wanted to so they thought it would be a great experience for my age and so I was picked to go make my first Australian team and I couldn't believe it my family couldn't believe it no one could believe it but it really was the start for me then and so I feel like I had a post-it on my wall all the time in my teenage teenage Nice. And really that was the catalyst for me to realise that I didn't want to ever not be a part of this training thing. I want to do this more than anything. So that was how I start and it was a lucky break is your law and then from then on it was like this is my path this is my journey this is my dreams it's what I want so it's very much birthed from that first page of the 15 year old I mean if you're becoming an elite athlete you want Olympic gold medals silver medals world championships I couldn't imagine it being too invested there's something you need to be when you reach that level you can't be anything other than too invested as an elite athlete it is all in you know I had people saying oh you're so lucky you get to miss school and you get to travel the world and you get to do this that and the other saying the glory side of it and I thought you know what you can get lucky too you just have the alarm before 37 tomorrow morning come training with me and maybe you'll get lucky too and so I had a real thing about that being called lucky because Because really throughout my career I had a little bit of natural talent but ultimately what got me there was a lot of hard work I had a great work ethic in the pool and it was just about just doing those k's and so it's all like swimming it's not just about every waking moment and every race it's about every training session it's about every sleeping moment it's about what you consume it's fuel for your body it's about how you recover it is literally your whole life revolves around being an elite athlete and in a sport that is won and lost by 100th of a second like the smallest margin there possibly is for every training session that you're not giving 100% for every recovery that you are not moving through and doing it to the best of your ability every time you don't give 100% in your whole life that could impact The result on race day. So it is definitely all in company and I was 100% probably not that stage to invest it, but I was 100% invested It sounds like something that's familiar to those early mornings or late nights Because all of your life is taken up with that achievement in the pool and you're really high achieving. Then what was it like then to step away from such a spectacularly successful career at the age of 23? This is your first career, your first switch. What was that like? What led you to that moment? How'd you know? It's quite extraordinary. Everyone wants to know from an athlete, when do you know when it's time to pull up? And it's only now that I look back and I wonder if it'd be different if times were different only because in that day, like I retired in 2006 and it's now 23, but I was mentally exhausted. I was burnt out. And back then, if you were burnt out, you retired. There was no chance for a mental health break. There was no chance to have a long break out of the pool. Our coaches believed that for every week that you spent out of the pool was three weeks it took to get back to where you were before that week. So taking a break was just. was just terrifying to be honest and so we only had two weeks off the year there's no off-season in swimming it is literally all in and i got to you don't get to do the part that you love which for me is high caliber racing twice a year so there's a long time doing all the other you know 24 7 full invested components to get to the part that you absolutely love so for me i was living up and down and i was training in melbourne at the amco and i realized the 2006 commonwealth games were coming up in that same pool that i just swam in and 2006 after the commonwealth games i was in training sitting up and down and i had this light bulb moment where i started to take stock of my achievements and i realized for the very first time that i was proud of myself i'd never thought about it like that i'd never really taken stock of what had happened because When you're in that mindset of what's next, life just has this incredible feeling and it becomes another. of I've since stated it is paid off the hard work has paid off and the best in the world or I'm you know I've got my dream of a little hanging around my neck all of those things it's an addiction because as much as you enjoy that tiny little moment it's like I want it again I need it again how do I get that again but I recognize that A I was proud of myself B I could not have done anything more to be any better than what I was I couldn't have done anything more I couldn't have trained any harder I couldn't have recovered any better I couldn't have managed injuries any better I couldn't have done anything more to be any better than what I was so that also had a realization attached to it that I had no regrets I was really comfortable with my career and then just a split second later if I'm proud of myself I'm comfortable with my career and I've got no regrets Then have I also just possibly in this light bulb moment of five minutes in its entirety also lost that one percent of absolute hunger that is required to win at the top level in this sport and be honest a personal component of me went probably yes so that gave me a sense of calm because I was like right well I've made the decision I've got six months until I swim in front of a home crowd in Melbourne at the Commonwealth Games and that will be my final competition and I didn't tell anyone except my family I didn't even tell my coach or my squad mates I wanted it to be business as usual and to go out when I was ready hopefully on a high at my decision and so that transition once I did walk away people like 23 you've got so much more there was still process or process of do I have anything left in the tank is another Olympics what I need to feel comfortable moving on anything like that I just felt really ready by the time I'd realized all of that and realized that I was comfortable and proud The rest of the lotto's already yours and that next step didn't seem so scary. We kind of didn't seem so scary. The problem is though,
Speaker B: Hi adrenaline
Speaker A: I just followed that with how do you know where to go next? I listened before I had the thing of you're so lucky, but I did feel very fortunate in this component that for the last few years of my semi-career I've got my channel nine and hence what at the time was like what are you gonna do when you hang out the talk show? Oh, I have no idea. It's like all right. Well if you get there come and see me and we'll see what we can do I guess I felt very confident walking in and at that stage they would throw you at every possible opportunity in TV and hard to pun you either swim or you say it was throw you in the deep end and see what happens And so I got to do all these It is different shows, but ultimately my start with something was very comfortable and very known because the next world championship is on Channel 9. And so that not only felt very comfortable in a known space, but every time I did live TV, I felt the same adrenaline, the same butterflies in my stomach, that same feeling of I've got one chance to get this right. And that ultimately felt like what my superpower was when I got up on the box on race day. I had that same feeling. So I saw a connection. I felt like something that I was good at over here had a correlation to maybe what my next career could be. And that gave me a sense of safety to your life, but especially also a sense of confidence. And you just look at that brush, right? That live TV breakthrough. So how do you remember being invested into your media career? I found it very difficult, to be honest, because all of a sudden there wasn't the same control over my own destiny I didn't feel in media that I hadn't swimming if I hadn't chose swimming I found a way to work harder found a way to work on my weaknesses weaknesses are your greatest area of growth how do I do that you know that makes me faster if I can get better at that something I found quite difficult even though I thought it was an easy transition into something that challenged me in the same ways far to get better at was a foreign concept because I felt like in some ways I'm 5'10 I'm average in the swimming world I'm an Amazon woman in TV land you know much taller and broad shoulders than I had muscles and if I had a male co-host or something like that then you know I definitely had not wear heels or anything like that it was very much the hardest challenge for me was I had gone from recognizing my body was a vehicle it was about what my body could do not what it looked like into a medium it was very much about what do you look like look like you know all those kind of things that it was very much I felt there was this element of like some control and I struggled with that but what I did love was that the biggest thing was is that every day was different no two days were the same I'd gone from absolute Groundhog days in the corporate the monotony because a pool is a pool no matter where you go in the world not like going for a bike ride or a run you can change the scenery and change your motivation a pool is the same parameters no matter where you are in the world so going to something that was so different and exciting and every day was different and there was no routine there was no two days were the same meant that I absolutely loved it and I loved it so I found a way to I always asked for feedback I always asked for people of how I could get better and that was from lovely makeup artists who if I was having a makeup When my makeup done, I would come with my makeup done and say tell me how to get better How I do this better if it was you know a sound recordist and I say I had one voice coach once who told How do we get rid of this nasally Queensland bogan accent? So I think being able to laugh at yourself, once again, very much being okay with having weaknesses, which is something that a couple of like four, something afraid of weaknesses, saying is that as an area for growth really helped me in the world of TV where I was absolutely starting from scratch.
Speaker B: You've asked a lot about winning and losing as a professional athlete. If someone who's won many times would have gone through a lot of losses as part of that process, bringing that back to ordinary people's lives, like mine, and people who are thinking of taking on new challenges like changing their career. Could you tell us a little bit about a time when you made a switch that didn't quite work out for you and what you learned from that?
Speaker A: I had many moments that didn't quite work out as well, and I'd like to preface it by saying I don't regret any of it. any of it.
Speaker B: Well those times where it didn't work once again exploration of having no regrets and saying I tried and it didn't work so therefore it allows me to move on clean from them but probably the hardest one the biggest one for me was I found myself being the web presenter on CPM News Channel 7 in Melbourne and I knew nothing about the weather so not only was I completely underprepared and under skilled for that role I'd also never done auto cue properly or been in front of a green screen properly before I'd also replaced a much loved meteorologist to do this job I was so out of my depth I was for the first time in studio leading my own segment if you like
Speaker A: And the only feedback I used to get was, I don't want someone telling me the weather and it's freezing outside. Why doesn't she have a cardigan on or her hair looks terrible that way or she doesn't have enough. I just absolutely got hammered in that role and probably luckily so because I wasn't the right fit for it but I couldn't find a way out I was missing out on support roles because I was attracted to the news department and therefore I felt like my credibility and something that I loved and I knew it was slipping away and instead it was the first time that I had been really heavily almost bullied I would say almost bullied from that side of people saying that I was terrible they didn't want me there so it was a really hard time and I have never been more I think gutted and down the dumps about something I couldn't change the narrative I couldn't fix it and that was incredibly difficult So these are something quite radical though. I mean, you went into macadamia nut farming. That wouldn't have been the next stop on my chart if I was charting your career. I mean, how did you end up there, John? I was lucky again, Sam, my husband has always been huge support for me and we had had out the child by the time, you know, I feel pretty was doing the weather and through that time I came back from maternity leave, back into the weather and wasn't enjoying it still, felt like I was a little bit lost, wasn't sure if I was, my future was still in TV, but ultimately we took a huge leap of faith where I left a network contract because I felt like I was losing control of my own narrative and I wanted to be able to say yes to projects that I wanted to do and I wanted to be able to explore. law other elements of my career if you like as well and if I left a network contracted for most people on CV that is akin to death it's like how could you possibly walk away from time on screen it's almost brain in a system that you define yourself or how much screen time you get how popular you are how well you can hope to show anything like that and so it was once again hacking the ego to the side and saying this isn't working for me anymore so having a crack has really stood me in good stead throughout my previous career my career up until this point so what's the worst thing that can happen I walk away and it doesn't work well then you know we'll find another way to reinvent myself so I've been really fortunate that that chaos we move back to Queensland I still have one child and no family that can help us in Melbourne we're very stuck in terms of two jobs that were not nine to five Monday to Friday so traditional child care was not an option for us and we moved to the Gold Coast which was home for me where I grew up and my parents were very happy to be supportive and help out as much as they could. I could. We just made it work. All of a sudden, you know, I leased into my ambassador roles once again that I had. I managed to be able to then go along with having swimming was it changed channels it changed network to different things I could attack it
Speaker B: from Yeah
Speaker A: a different side so I felt like I was back in control of my own narrative and that was the most important thing for me. But then living on the Gold Coast my husband's name is a fifth generation farmer and his business is in livestock and we had always been looking for a property a long story short we came across this property that was a macadamia farm. I discount it because I don't know anything about macadamias but we're here let's go and have a look and we came down the driveway two little kids in the back and we fell in love with it was a little farmhouse there was a horse in the kind of cake that all the kids were playing with and was like hey the real estate agent and the owners were very clever in in the brochure what does a macadamia farm produce how does that work so for the thing is here i know nothing about Like a Damien's Gardens and Soil Health, I understand. Farming, I understand. Machinery, I understand. How will that work? Surely how can a Damien's farming be? And once again, like everything in both our lives, it's like a crap. And we just fell in love with the community. And then ultimately the universe said that's the ultimate light bulb moment, if you like, when that farm next door came up for sale and it came with machinery and shared with machinery. It was twice the size of our farm. It was a proper macadamia farm in all senses of the word. And there wasn't even a fence between the two properties. And we were like, are we doing this? Are we doing this? And ultimately, once again, it was like, yes, let's do this. We love it down here. As long as I can have proximity to some kind of airport, I'm going to have to travel for work no matter where I live. So. So why not go on this journey again? Did you throw yourself into farming with the same zeal and I guess adrenaline that you would have thrown yourself into that pool all those years earlier? Yes, but here's the thing. Farming was the first time that the equations that I had been successful in every other aspect of my life didn't work. Because every other component of my career I had been able to find a solution to the problem I had been able to workshop through it, I'd been able to work harder to achieve a goal, I'd been able to educate myself more so that I knew what I was talking about or whatever it was. Farming, it doesn't matter how hard you work, how innovative you are, how passionate you are, any of that, because there are so many items that are out of your control, namely Mother Nature, first and foremost. and B, commodity prices, things like that, market prices, where you can plan to the best of your ability and a really good farmer will find a way to go. With that flexibility he like whereas I was like hang on a second you mean we could put everything into this and we could do everything we could throw everything at the rest of the sun and it still could not work right that's farming so ultimately the passion project it has to be a passion project first of all you have to love it and for the first few years we said we were farming for the lifestyle because every dollar we made if we made a dollar went back into the farm so we were farming for a lifestyle but ultimately that lifestyle was something that gave us so much energy so much joy and it just felt right so if you had told me 10 years ago that I'd be living on a farm and I'd be a farmer's wife and attempting to you know be as good as my husband using the farming world I would have thought you were off your head whereas here we are and I couldn't be happier there are so many things i love about your career trajectory but i think one of my favorite is the fact that you started off in the pool and ended up on a farm so inspiring the way you started with you be and i mean i take courage to keep pivoting and pivoting and pivoting from the women who are considering a career change a pivot a switch in whatever capacity in their career or their life what would you say to them don't let anything define you let you define you you can be so multifaceted you can have so many strings to your bow you can be everything or nothing if you don't want don't let a job or a career or a label define you define yourself and find a way to explore everything anything that you're interested in because that's my first tip my second tip is i really think the whole point of being human and being on this planet what we're all trying to achieve ultimately Lee, he's happiness, we want to die one day happy and at peace with no regrets. That's my plan anyway, most people I speak to that would be the ultimate way to end up. How it exists is to be happy, at peace with our lives, and to have no regrets. So the only way we're ever going to achieve that or have a chance of achieving that is to have a crack at every opportunity that there is, leave no stone unturned, have no regrets by chasing everything that is. If you've got one little inkling of a feeling that you should do something or need to do something or want to do something, you need to explore it because it will only fester on, particularly later in life. And ultimately, what's the worst that can happen if it fails and you pivot again or you find a way to use that experience to go on to the next thing? Because happiness at the end of the day is not worth taking a risk for, then nothing is in my book. Where's the good bye? Giovanni, thank you so much for joining us on the podcast today. It's been such a pleasure speaking with you. Was it all a lie that that didn't do? Next time on Too Much, FW's own Jamila Risby, the political advisor who made her way into media and then to champion equality for women. I very unexpectedly got diagnosed with a brain tumour on the Monday after they both offered me the job on the Thursday and Friday before. I didn't know what life was going to look like in three months, six months and ten years all of a sudden. And I didn't know if I'd be alive in that period of time, let alone working. Too Much is a podcast series proudly supported by Victoria Police, who are looking for more women to join their ranks. Considering making the switch and explore a career with Victoria Police.
