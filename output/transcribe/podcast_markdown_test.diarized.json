Consider making the switch and explore a career with Victoria Police. For the link in the show notes, go ahead to police.vic.gov.au I felt like I was losing control of my own narrative. So I left the network contractors For most people on TV, that is akin to death. It's like, how could you possibly walk away from climbing the screen? Every woman remembers a time they were too something at work. Too ambitious, too soft, too bossy. Hi, I'm Brianna Blackett, your host for season three of Too Much, The Switch. I started out as a journalist. I lived abroad and traveled the world, helping to cover breaking news. I co-founded an international news organization. But this is becoming my parents and solo carer to my two kids.\nIt is my working life has needed to change over and over again and I'm not alone join me as I interview eight extraordinary women who made the switch from one career to another and sound success We'll also find out how defying the suffocating stereotypes women face at work helped them get there\nShe was winning Olympic gold medals and world championships in the pool, but at the glittering peak of her career, she was burned out. At age 23, Jian retired from competitive swimming, and she chased new adrenaline highs as a TV presenter. But when this career path landed her in a job that didn't fit and saw her receiving harsh criticism from viewers, Jian pivoted again, and this time, it was a switch you would never see coming. Today, Jian joins us to travel through her pivots and explore how, at each turn, being too invested has seen her rise to dazzling heights, and how putting aside ego has given her the courage to change lanes and have a crack at something new.\nJohnny takes so much for joining us on Too Much. Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to have a chat. Yeah, well let's see if I'm talking to women who have made the switch from one career to another. In your words, can you tell us a little bit about your career journey? I think I've switched careers three or four times already. I feel it's happened many, many times in my nearly 43 years on the planet. And I think for me it's been a really exciting journey because it means I've been able to explore each one throughout its entirety and then it's segued or the universe has led me to what is next. And I think for me the biggest thing has always been listening to what's out there, taking advantage of opportunities and if something is, I guess, having this little bit of excitement about exploring that particular path, then you've got to go for it. Well, with language with two invested, as your true self and you're too much.\nCan you tell us a little bit about what being too invested looks like? I guess I do everything with a lot of passion, with a lot of emotion. And if I'm going to explore something, if I'm going to have a say about something, if I'm going to be conversational or in-depth in anything in my life, then I need to be heavily invested. I need to make sure that I'm researched. I need to know that I know what I'm talking about. I know my stuff. And ultimately, that is what gives me the confidence to be out there and public and having a go and having a crack. So definitely throughout my life, I think to invest it is a great way to describe me. Well, I'm really keen to jump into helping to invest to help you and certain things in your career, but let's start where your career began. You're\nYour actual career Yeah, began because... at the age of 15. Can you tell us what it was like when you joined the Australian swimming team? Was that childhood dream of yours? It actually wasn't funnily enough. I failed at very much failing to swimming. I kind of complained. I looked at him as a baby. I had straight correction as a child, but it wasn't until I was at my private school swimming carnival as a living and I managed to do fairly well. And then a few moments and a friend of mine who was a year older in the grade above me said, you're really good. You should join my swimming club. I was like, that sounds great. I asked mom and dad. So at 11, I started squad training and I started two afternoons a week and I loved it so much that I begged to go three afternoons a week and it really just grew from there. I could not spend more time in the pool. I absolutely loved it. And then once my coach Dennis Cottrell said, you know, you've got a real chance to do something in the sport of swimming, but you need to dedicate yourself to it now. And that means moving to training.\nin between the training and that means morning training you gotta do it while you're young you've gotta put in the hard yards now so I won't give you the 12 months and see what happens so that's exactly what I did and I went to those Australian championships as a 15 year old and with no thought process of making Australian team and I hadn't even made the Queensland team at that stage to go to this Australian championships I just got my time that was a qualifying time and so when I got third in the women's 100 backstroke as a 15 year old they didn't need to select me on the team it's only the top two that are guaranteed if you like and third place for a common games team back then had a bit of judges selection if you like there was a criteria they could take you if they wanted to it was when they thought it would be great experience for my age and so I was 15 I made myself Australian team and I couldn't believe it my family couldn't believe it no one could believe it but it really was a start for me then and\nand if people had ever posted on my wall all the stuff on my page and really that was the catalyst for me to realize that I didn't want to ever not be a part of your space and thing I wanted this more than anything so that was all I had to start and it was a lucky break if you like and then from then on it was like this is my path this is my journey this is my dream this is what I want so it's very much birthed from that first page of this 15 year old I mean if you became an elite athlete you won Olympic gold medals silver medals world championships I would imagine that being too invested there's something you need to be when you reach that level you can't be anything other than too invested as an elite athlete it is all in you know I had people saying oh you also like you get to miss school and you get to travel the world and you get to do this that the other thing the glory side of it\nstarted and I thought you know what you can get lucky too you just have to get lucky to get in tomorrow morning come training with me and maybe you'll get lucky too and so I had a real thing about that being called lucky because really throughout my career I had a little bit of natural talent but ultimately what got me there was a lot of hard work I had great work ethic in the pool and it was just about just doing those k's so it's more like swimming it's not just about every waking moment and every race it's about every training session it's about every sleeping moment it's about what you consume as fuel for your body it's about how you recover it is literally your whole life revolves around being an elite athlete and in a sport that is one and lost by 100th of a second like the smallest margin there possibly is for every training session\nthat you're not giving 100% for every recovery that you are not moving through it and doing it to the best of your ability every time you don't give 100% in your whole life that could impact the result on race day so it is definitely all encompassing and I was 100% probably not at that stage to invest it but I was 100% invested It sounds like you've always been invested for me both early mornings and late nights because all of your life is taken up with that achievement in the pool and you're really high achieving. Then what was it like then to step away from such a spectacularly successful career at the age of 22? Is this your first career event, your first switch or was it like what led you to that moment? How'd you know? it's kind of true everyone wants to know if an athlete went you know when it's time to pull up\nPull up and it's only now that I wonder if it'd be different if times were different only because in that day I retired in 2006 and it's now 23 but I was mentally exhausted I was burnt out and back then if you were burnt out you retired there was no chance for a mental health break there was no chance to have a long break out of the pool our coaches believed that every week that you spent out of the pool was three weeks it took to get back to where you were before that week but taking a break was just terrifying to be honest and so we only had two weeks off the year there's no off-season in swimming it is literally all in I got to you don't get to do the part that you love which for me is high caliber racing twice a year so there's a long time doing all the other you know 24-7 full invested components\nI'm not here to get to the part that you absolutely love. Okay, so now it's nearly up and down and I was trading in Melbourne under AMP Uh and -huh. I realized the 2006 Commonwealth Games were coming up in that same pool that I swam in. And since I was out from the Commonwealth Games, I was in training, swimming up and down and I had this light bulb moment where I started to take stock of my achievements and I realized for the very first time that I was proud of myself. I'd never thought about it like that. I'd never really taken stock of what had happened because when you're in that mindset of what's next? I've just had this incredible feeling and it becomes an addiction of I've succeeded, it is paid off, the hard work has paid off, I'm the best in the world or I've got my dream of Olympic medal hanging around my neck, all of those things.\nIt's an addiction because as much as you enjoy that tiny little moment, it's like, I want it again. I need it again. How do I get that again? But I recognise that I am proud of myself. B, I could not have done anything more to be any better than what I was. I couldn't have done anything more. I couldn't have trained any harder. I couldn't have recovered any better. I couldn't have managed injuries any better. I couldn't have done anything more to be any better than what I was. So that also had a realisation attached to it that I had no regrets. I was really comfortable with my career. And then in a split second later, if I'm proud of myself, I'm comfortable with my career and I've got no regrets, then have I also just possibly in this lightbulb moment of five minutes in its entirety also lost that 1% of absolute hunger?\nanger that is required to win at the top level in this sport and be honest my personal component of me went probably yes so that gave me as I probably have made the decision I've got six months until I swim in front of a home crowd in Melbourne at the Commonwealth Games and that will be my final competition and I didn't tell anyone except my family I didn't even tell my coach or my squad mates I wanted it to be business as usual and to go out when I was ready hopefully on a high at my decision and so that transition once I did walk away people like you're 23 you've got so much more there's always still process of do I have anything left in the tank is there another Olympics where I need to feel comfortable moving on anything like that I just felt really ready by the time I'd realized all of that and realized that I was comfortable and proud\nProud and was I regret that I was late to all of them that next yet I've been seen so scary. We claim it didn't seem so scary The problem is though, high adrenaline career, much to follow that with. How do you know where to go next? I said before I hate the thing of you're so lucky But I did feel very fortunate in the component that for the last few years I've mostly been able to do my channel 9 and hence a lot of time was like what are you gonna do when you hang out the contract? So I don't know I've got no idea. It's like all right Well if you get there come and see me and we'll see what we can do I guess I felt very confident walking in and at that stage they would throw you at every possible opportunity in TV and pardon the pun You either swim or you sink. It was throw you in the deep end and see what happens. And so I got to do all these\nThese different shows, but ultimately I started with something that was very comfortable and very known because the next world championship is on Channel 9. And so that not only felt very comfortable in a known space, but every time I did live TV, I felt the same adrenaline, the same butterflies in my stomach, that same feeling of I've got one chance to get this right. And that ultimately felt like what my superpower was when I got up on the box on race day. I had that same feeling. So I saw a connection, I felt like something that I was good at over here had a correlation to maybe what my next career could be. And that gave me a sense of safety, if you like, but especially also sense of confidence. And you still get that rush, right? That live TV brings you. So how do you bring being invested into your media career?\nI found it very difficult, to be honest, because all of a sudden there wasn't the same control over my own destiny I didn't feel in media that I hadn't swimming. Because I had these dreams of doing a featherweight to work harder, I found a way to work on my weaknesses. Weaknesses are your greatest area of growth. How do I do that? You know, that makes me faster if I can get better at that. So taking I found quite difficult, even though I thought it was an easy transition into something that challenged me in the same way. It's hard to get better at it with a foreign concept because I felt like in someone's own 5'10 average in the swimming world, I'm an Amazon woman in TV land. You know, much taller in broad shoulders than I had muscles. And if I had my old co-host or something like that, then, you know, I definitely had not wear heels or anything like that.\nthing like that it was very much the hardest challenge for me was I'd gone from recognizing my body was a vehicle and it was about what my body could do not what it looked like and for me and it was very much about what do you look like you know all those kind of things that it was very much I felt there was this element of like from control and I struggled with that but what I did love was that the biggest thing was is that every day was different no two days were the same I'd gone from absolute groundhog days in the pool the monotony because the pool is the pool no matter where you go in the world not like going for a bike ride or a run you can change the scenery and change your motivation a pool is the same parameters no matter where you are in the world so going Right. for something that was so different and exciting and every day was different and there was no\nno routine there was no two days were the same method I absolutely loved it and relish it so I found a way to I always asked for feedback I always asked for people of how I could get better and that was from lovely makeup artists who if I was having my makeup done I would come with my makeup done and say tell me how to get better how I do this better if it was you know a sound recorder some stage I had one voice coach once who told me that right how do we get rid of this nasally Queensland bogan accent so I think being able to laugh at yourself once again very much being okay with having weaknesses which is something that I've become probably explored not being afraid of weaknesses seeing it as an area for growth really helped me in the world of TV where I was absolutely starting from scratch you must learn a lot about winning and losing as a professional athlete\nGreat. If Elon has won many times, would have gone through a lot of losses as part of that process. Bringing that back to ordinary people's lives like mine and people who are thinking of taking on new challenges like changing a career. Could you tell us a little bit about a time when you made a switch that didn't quite work out for you and what you learned from that? I had many moments that didn't quite work out as well and I'd like to preface it by saying I don't regret any of it. All those times where it didn't work. Once again, exploration of having no regrets and saying I tried it and it didn't work. So therefore, it allows me to move on clean from them. But probably the hardest one, the biggest one for me was I found myself being the weather presenter on the 6pm news for Channel 7 in Melbourne and I knew nothing about the weather.\nYeah. So not only was I completely underprepared and underqualified for that role, I'd also never done auto-Q properly or been in front of a green screen properly before, I also replaced a much-loved meteorologist to do this job. I was so out of my depth. I was for the first time in studio leading my own segment, if you like, and the only feedback I used to get was, I don't want someone telling me the weather and it's freezing outside. Why doesn't she have a cardigan on or her hair looks terrible that way or she doesn't have enough lipstick on. I just absolutely got hammered in that role and probably luckily so because I wasn't the right fit for it. But\nI couldn't find a way out. I was missing out on sport roles because I was attracted to the news department and therefore I felt like my credibility in something that I loved and I knew was slipping away. And instead it was the first time that I had been really heavily almost bullied, I would say almost bullied from that side of people saying I was terrible and they didn't want me there. So it was a really hard time and I have never been more, I think gutted and down the dumps about something I couldn't change the narrative, I couldn't fix it. And that was incredibly difficult. So they do something quite radical though. I mean, you went into macadamia nut farming. That wouldn't have been the next stop on my chart if I was charting your career. I mean, how did you end up there, John?\nI was lucky again. My husband has always been huge support for me and we had had our first child by the time, and you know, it's your pretty much during the weather. And through that time, I came back from maternity leave back into the weather and wasn't enjoying it still. Felt like I was a little bit lost, wasn't sure if I was, my future was still in TV. But ultimately, we took a huge leap of faith where I left a network contract because I felt like I was losing control of my own narrative. And I wanted to be able to say yes to projects that I wanted to do. And I wanted to be able to explore other elements of my career, if you like as well. And so I left a network contract. And for most people on TV, that is akin to death. It's like, how could you possibly walk away from.\nFrom tightening screen, it's almost ingrained in the system that you define yourself by how much screen time you get, how popular you are, how well you can post a show, anything like that. And so it was once again harking the ego to the side and saying, this isn't working for me anymore. So having a crack has really stood me in good stead throughout my previous career, my career up until this point. So what's the worst thing that could happen? I walk away and it doesn't work. Well then, you know, we'll find another way to reinvent myself. So I've been really fortunate that that payoff, we moved back to Queensland. I still have one child and no family that can help us in Melbourne. We're very stuck in terms of two jobs that were not nine to five Monday to Friday. So traditional childcare was not an option for us. And we moved to the Gold Coast, which was home for me where I grew up. My parents were very happy to be supportive and help out. That's my.\nNow, as much as I could, we just made it work. All of a sudden, you know, I leased my ambassador roles once again that I had. I managed to be able to then go along with the feminist swimming ones. There's a change channels, there's a change networks. But did different things. I could attack it from a different side. So I felt like I was back in control of my own narrative. And that was the most important thing for me. But then living on the Gold Coast, my husband's name is a fifth generation farmer and his business is in livestock. And we had always been looking for a property. A long story short, we came across this property that was a macadamia farm. I've been like, oh, I discounted it because I don't know anything about macadamias. But we're here, let's go and have a look. And we came down the driveway, two little kids in the back and we fell in love with it. There's a little farmhouse. There was a horse in the paddock.\nkind of like that all the kids were playing with sam was like okay the real estate agent and the owners were very clever in in the brochure what does a macadamia farm produce how does that work sam said the thing is yeah i know nothing about macadamias but i understand soil health i understand farming i understand machinery i understand how all that works surely how hard can macadamia farming be and once again like everything in both our lives let's have a crack and we just fell in love with the community and then ultimately the universe said that's the ultimate light bulb moment if you like when that farm next door came up for sale and it came with some machinery shared with machinery was Yes twice the size of our farm it was a proper macadamia farm in all senses of the word and there wasn't even a fence between the two properties and we were like are we doing this are we are we doing this and ultimately once again it was like\nlike yes let's do this would you love it down here as long as I can have proximity to some kind of airport I'm gonna have to travel for work no matter where I live so why not go on this journey again Did you throw yourself into farming with the same zeal and I guess adrenaline that you would have thrown yourself into that pool all those years ago yes but here's the thing farming was the first time that the equation that I had been successful in every other aspect of my life didn't work because every other component of my career I had been able to find a solution to the problem I had been able to workshop through it I'd been able to work harder to achieve a goal I'd been able to educate myself more so that I knew what I was talking about whatever it was\ngot planning it doesn't matter how hard you work how innovative you are how passionate you are any of that because there are so many items that are out of your control namely mother nature first and foremost and b commodity prices things like that market prices where you can plan as best of your ability and a really good farmer find a way to go with that flexibility if you like whereas i was like hang on a second you mean we could put everything into this and we could do everything we could throw everything at it raise lots of finance and it still could not work right that's farming so ultimately the passion project it has to be a passion project first and foremost you have to love it and for the first few years we said we were farming for the lifestyle because every dollar we made if we made a dollar went back into the farm so we were farming for a lifestyle\nstuff but ultimately that lifestyle was something that gave us so much energy so much joy and it just felt right so if you had told me 10 years ago that i've been living on a farm and i'd be a farmer's wife and attempting to you know be as good as my husband using the farming world i would have thought you were off your head whereas here we are and i couldn't be happier there are so many things i love about your career trajectory but i think one of my favorites is the fact that you started off in the pool and ended up on a farm so far from where you thought you'd be and have we not encouraged you to keep pivoting and pivoting and pivoting for other women who are considering a career change a pivot a switch in whatever capacity in their personal life what would you say to them don't let anything define you let you define you you can be so multi-faceted you can have so many strings to your bow you can be\nthe everything or nothing if you don't want to neglect a job or a career or a label define you define yourself and find a way to explore everything anything that you're interested in so that's my first bit my second bit is i really think the whole point of being human and being on this planet what we're all trying to achieve ultimately is happiness we want to die one day happy and at peace with no regrets that's my plan anyway most people i speak to that would be the ultimate way to end our period of existence is to be happy at peace with our life and to have no regrets so the only way we're ever going to achieve that Mm-hmm. or have a chance of achieving that is to have a crack at every opportunity that there is leave no stone unturned\nHave no regrets by chasing everything that is if you've got one little inkling of a feeling that you should do something or need to do something or want to do something You need to explore it because it will only fester on particularly later in life and ultimately what's the worst that can happen if fails and you pivot again or you find a way to use that experience to go on to The next thing because if happiness at the end of the day is not worth taking a risk for then nothing is in my book Where's the good vibe? Joni, thank you so much for joining us on the podcast today. It's been such a pleasure speaking with you. Oh lovely to chat. Thank you\nIn that time, on Too Much, FW's own Jamila Rizvi, the political advisor who made her way into media, and then to champion equality for women. I very unexpectedly got diagnosed with a brain tumour on the Monday after they both offered me the job on the Thursday and Friday before. I didn't know what life was going to look like in three months, six months, in ten years, all of a sudden. I didn't know if I'd be alive in that period of time, let alone working.
